# Deep Learning for Sentiment Analysis of Financial News

The goal of this project is to assist hedge fund managers, pension fund managers, and other equity fund managers in assessing the public sentiment about their investments and determining the health of their fund. The project aims to leverage public sentiment analysis to identify emerging trends and market shifts, detect early warnings about market changes and potential crises, and augment technical analysis with granular sentiment analysis on each equity for a robust risk management strategy.

## Objectives

- Leverage public sentiment analysis to identify emerging trends and market shifts
- Detect early warnings about market changes and potential crises
- Augment technical analysis with granular sentiment analysis on each equity for a robust risk management strategy

## Technology

- Python libraries like Beautiful Soup, Selenium, and Scrapy for web scraping and extracting relevant information from websites
- Visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly for creating compelling visual representations
- Libraries like SpaCy and PyTorch for tokenization, feature extraction, model development, and optimization

## Current & Future Developments

- Employ web scraping tools to extract relevant data from financial news websites, and social media platforms
- Utilize cutting-edge NLP techniques, such as recurrent neural networks, transformers, and hyperparameter tuning
- Analyze and process textual data from various sources to derive sentiment scores
- Employ machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify and score sentiment data
- Employ advanced visualization techniques, such as heatmaps, network graphs, and sentiment score plots
- Leverage cloud-based solutions and distributed computing technologies for scalability
- Use containerization technologies like Docker to package and deploy the project's components
- Ensure the project remains efficient and reliable as data volume and complexity increase
- Adapt to changes in market conditions, data sources, and investment strategies
- Incorporate feedback and new insights to continuously enhance the project's effectiveness

By leveraging the power of web scraping, deep learning techniques, and advanced visualization, this project seeks to provide valuable insights into the public perception of companies and the overall health of investment portfolios. In doing so, it aims to help fund managers make data-driven decisions based on both historical stock prices and sophisticated, granular sentiment analysis.
