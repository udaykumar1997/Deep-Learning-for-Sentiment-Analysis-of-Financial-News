# Deep Learning for Sentiment Analysis of Financial News
The goal of this project is to assist hedge fund managers, pension fund managers, and other equity fund managers in assessing the public sentiment about their investments and determining the health of their fund. To achieve this, the project will involve web scraping and some application of deep learning or machine learning techniques.  The composition of the funds will be provided in terms of names of companies and the percentage of exposure. The project will scrape the internet for information about these companies from financial news websites, social media platforms, and financial data providers. The scraped data will be used to analyze the sentiment of the articles or mentions related to the companies. This analysis will help fund managers understand how the market perceives the companies and how it might affect their funds.  To perform sentiment analysis on the scraped data, the project will use natural language processing (NLP) techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers. These techniques have been shown to perform well on natural language tasks like sentiment analysis. The sentiment analysis results will be used to inform investment decisions, and fund managers can use this information to constantly assess the public sentiment about their investments. Overall, this project aims to provide a tool for equity fund managers to track the sentiment of their investments in real-time and make data-driven decisions. By leveraging the power of web scraping and deep learning techniques, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into the public perception of companies and the overall health of investment portfolios.
Currently financial institutions predominatly use the historical stock price of a companies to predict the movement of stock prices. This Project introduces sentiment to the equation, in a very sophisticated and granular manner.
