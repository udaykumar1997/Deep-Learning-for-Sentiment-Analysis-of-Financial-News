The following code block appears to be scraping data from Hindenburg Research website. But it seems to be creating a new df instead of appending to the previous df. I'm afraid it might overwrite/erase the previously scraped data from yahoo News which is currently in df.
Also, the format appears to be incoherent with the previous df.

Code Block:
search_term = input("Enter a search term: ")
# Get user input for the URL
url = f'https://hindenburgresearch.com/{search_term}'
# response = requests.get(url)
# Send a GET request to the URL and parse the HTML content
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Extract all headers and their related paragraphs
headers = {}
current_header = None
for element in soup.find_all(['h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', 'p']):
    if element.name.startswith('h'):
        # If a new header is found, update the current header
        current_header = element.text.strip()
        headers[current_header] = []
    elif current_header is not None:
        # If a paragraph is found, add it to the list of paragraphs for the current header
        headers[current_header].append(element.text.strip())

# Create a list of dictionaries with the title, summary and source information
data = []
for header, paragraphs in headers.items():
    data.append({
        'title': header,
        'summary': ' '.join(paragraphs),
        'source': url
    })

# Create a dataframe from the list of dictionaries
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Print the dataframe
print(df)










Information about the dataframe, for additional context.
Commands:
df.info()
df.describe()
